# CRUD-College-Courses

I made this program as my midterm project for my GUI college course. The course used Visual Basic .NET.

This program allows you to create, read, update, and delete courses.

It was a very challenging piece of software to write. I was required to use only one form file but have three different sections that the user can switch to, and I was only allowed to use Visual Basic's components covered in class. Also, I had to work around event handlers so that the wrong ones wouldn't activate when I make changes within the program. It took a lot of work to debug and I managed to get it to where my professor and I could not break it.
